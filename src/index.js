/**
 * from https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/data-model/q/integration/react
 * Now that youâ€™ve created and configured a React app and initialized a new Amplify project, 
 * you can add a feature. The first feature you will add is an API.
 * The Amplify CLI supports creating and interacting with two types of API categories: REST and GraphQL.
 * The API you will be creating in this step is a GraphQL API using AWS AppSync (a managed GraphQL service) and the database will be Amazon DynamoDB (a NoSQL database).
 * 
 * Add a GraphQL API to your app and "automatically provision a database" by running the following command from 
 * the root of your application directory: amplify add api
 *
